The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced by Nintendo. Nintendo first released it in Japan as the Family Computer (FC), commonly known as the Famicom, in 1983. The NES, a redesigned version, made its debut in test markets in the United States in October 1985, before becoming widely available in the rest of North America and other countries during the following years.

The purpose of this project is to gain profound knowledge on the software and hardware architecture behind this system, and understand the interplay between them. Nevertheless, it was an amazing learning experience.

## How to Build

### Dependencies

Before building this project the following must be installed :
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)

### CMake

To keep this project platform independent CMake is used to generate the build files.
To install cmake in Windows, I used [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) which is a package manager.

The following definitions can be used to locate the dependencies if they are not found automatically:
- CMAKE\_INCLUDE\_PATH
- CMAKE\_LIBRARY\_PATH

### Windows

I used [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the dependencies on Windows.

After setting up vcpkg, the following code snippets illustrate how to install the required dependencies.

```
vcpkg install glfw3:x64-windows
vcpkg install glew:x64-windows
vcpkg install portaudio:x64-windows
```

Once done, create a folder where you would want the repository to be cloned and perform the following commands to build the emulator.

```
git clone https://github.com/Sarvesh2k/NES_Emulator
cd NES_Emulator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path-to-vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
```

### Linux

I haven't tried out running the emulator in linux based systems, but given that the project was intended to be platform independent, this will be explored in future iterations and the readme file will be updated.

For the curious, the following dependencies must be installed before proceeding (Ubuntu):

- `libglew-dev`
- `libglfw3-dev`
- `portaudio19-dev`

## How to Use the Emulator

### Running the emulator

This emulator opens the file passed through the command line arguments.
The NES_Emulator executable can be found in `<path-to-cloned-repo>\build\Debug`

```
(in the repo)
cd build\Debug
.\NES-Emulator <path-to-game-file>
```

The game file (i.e. the .nes file) can also be dragged onto the executable.

### Controls

The controls can be set up in a `settings.ini` file.

The default controls are

Player 1:
```
Directional Pad - WASD
Select - G
Start - H
A - K
B - J
```

Player 2:
```
Directional Pad - Arrow Keys
Select - Keypad 1
Start - Keypad 2
A - Keypad 3
B - Keypad 0
```

## Mappers supported

The mappers currently supported are NROM (0), MMC1 (1), UxROM (2), CNROM (3) and MMC3 (4).
the NES cartidges released in the US have only been used for testing.

## Scope of Improvement

This project was developed to obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying architecture behind the NES consoles, and hence was developed for the sole purpose of learning.

Some points that I noted that needed improvement are as follows:
- Gameplay optimization (testing brought about 50-60 FPS and 30-40 FPS in memory intensive games)
- External controller support (only provided support for keyboard)
- More Mapper support (would be a fun challenge ;))
